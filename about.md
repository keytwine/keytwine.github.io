As developer, I know multiple languages specially Golang, Ruby, Python. I do development of
backing and platform services, and also able to analyse, customise
and/or contribute back to existing projects and software.

Experience working and automating AWS, some with GCE & Azure, but also private clouds (e.g. VMware).

Worked with platform as code and automation tooling like terraform, ansible, chef, etc.

I got experience in implementing Continuous Integration (CI) and
Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines in all sizes of development teams
and organisations. I am specifically fond of new CI systems like http://concourse.ci .

I am advocate and really fond of DevOps practices and principles: automation,
infrastructure as code, reduce feedback loops, self service,
cross team collaboration, etc.
