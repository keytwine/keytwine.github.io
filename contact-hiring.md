What I am looking for in any project
------------------------------------

I am mainly looking to work on developing cross-functional backing services
for automation in cloud environments. Also deployments with a load of
development of customisations and contributions upstream.
These are services like PaaS, containers schedulers, service discovery, CI, CDNs, etc.

I want to put in use all my skills and capacities as software&platform
engineer to push, grow and evolve them, by actively architecting and
developing systems and platforms.

I am looking to work within a development delivery team, who use XP and agile
methodologies. A team with a defined but flexible vision and roadmap,
formed by professionals who are able to pair and learn, who are fun,
humble and honest, who value craftsmanship and software engineering.

My profile consist in a CS masters degree, a fair background in
Software development (from OOP to functional programming) and experienced
DevOps practices and the "webops" skills and tooling.
I am keen and experienced on Linux, networking, cloud, software engineering,
etc.

All these grounds allow me to quickly learn and understand new tech on the field.

I would rather avoid get into "Jack of all trades" position, a simple
resource that "makes stuff work". In part I do enjoy that
involve  switching between tasks of different nature, e.g.: add a feature to a
HTTP router in golang, automate a DB deployment on AWS,
troubleshoot a issue in a 3rd party software. But at the end I feel
less accomplished, like not working in a real project and
not delivering and much as I could.

Finally, I more than keen to work on open source code, or work in the open.
I believe in the share knowledge, collaboration, and that it increases of
quality and accountability of development.
